Hi.

So, after enough family and professors telling me, I have made a blog. This will either become a regular thing, or I'll forget about it after a few days.

Aaaaaanyways, enough of that. Let's get to introductions.

I'm quagzlor. I play video games, watch shows and anime, read, mess about with software and occasionally write.

Wow, how original, you must be thinking. Well, aren't you one to judge. Yes, I'm talking to you. You, the carbon based life-form with blobs and non-blobs. Don't you give me that sass.

Anyways, I'll post whatever comes to mind. Let's see where it goes. Fun fun fun.
