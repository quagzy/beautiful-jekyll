So. I just finished watching the movie, and so honestly, odds are that I'm still riding its high.

But, _damn_. _God damn_, that was a good movie. I loved it. I absolutely loved it, and I've pretty much been off superhero movies since the Dark Knight films, barring Deadpool. (I should watch Logan too, since that has more of a mature theme, so that's there.)

Now, this is about the writing. Visuals, action etc are up to Marvel's great standards, so not really much comment on that.

So, let me start off with the gripes about superhero movies in general. Now, this includes Marvel and DC, and I've not really watched any films of their lately after seeing Civil War. I was hyped about Suicide Squad, but after hearing what a mess it was, I opted for just getting the soundtrack, and leaving it at that. (Soundtrack's not bad, btw. At least I like it.)

Here's the thing. The movies just aren't interesting. Full of one-liners, action, low-impact dialogue about morality and ethics, etc. (I realise that I may be using the wrong words, but to find the right ones I'd have to go back and watch some of the films again, and that's not happening.)

The films are just... okay. Some are bad, some are eeeenh, but none really catch the eye. Deadpool stood out with the R rating, Deadpool being... well, him, and it poking fun at tropes. It was a fun movie, but not something that really made me love it.

However, Spiderman Homecoming, (which I'll just call Spidy, because who wants to type that mess over and over?) stands out. Why? Because it is just such a good example of good storytelling, especially in an established universe.

Now, to do this, I'll be using some examples from the film, so **spoiler alert!** You have been warned.

So, let's look at the villain. He's a dude who saw a mess, and saw an opportunity to make some money off of it. Then some big company sweeps in and takes over, and he loses out. Now, this guy has a family to feed. As do many of the others who join him. So they start making things with the alien tech.

Now, morally, is this right? God no. He's a criminal, plain and simple. But he's doing it for his family, something which I feel we can understand. After all, wouldn't you do whatever it takes to support the ones you care about?

So, first and most important point. A villain who we can understand and identify with. Someone who makes sense. Someone who started out just trying to do what they could to support and protect their family, but ended up going down the wrong path. (We do see how his greed has overtaken the necessity however, when we see his home and lifestlye.)

Then, character development. Peter Parker. So first off, I'm giving the concession of it being compressed, considering that it's a film, and the time which comics or shows may use to set up character development simply isn't there. 

It shows exactly what Peter is; a teenager given access to some amazing technology, and special abilities who goes wild. He gets ahead of himself, tries to do things beyond his experience on his own, and while I can definitely understand why he was doing it, and agree to an extent, it was also good to see the consequences of his actions. 

He goes and messes something up, and people almost die because of it. Also, credit to Tony Stark here, we also get to see some character development from him, where he sees his own mistakes and keeps an eye on Peter as a result. Was really good to see that.

Finally, the general atmosphere. The interactions felt... well, not natural, but smooth. There's awkwardness, there's nervousness, he doesn't just snap off snazzy one liners, some of them are actually pretty meh, and there's Ned.

Oh man, Ned. Let's be honest, if we found out our friend was a superhero, we would probably be in a similar position.

1. It would be totally cool.
2. We'd want to do something to help them.

(We might also be concerned for their safety, but hey, we're here for a good time, not a long time.)

So, we finally come to the elephant in the room. Though we can't really call her an elephant, because _god damn, son_. Aunt May. No, not the kind, elder lady of the older series.

I'm talking about the young, good looking woman that she is now. So, was it weird? Funnily enough, no. (Disclaimer here, I'm not exactly a strong fan of the series, so I feel my view on this would be vastly different from the die hard fans. Maybe not, but maybe.)

She reminds me of Hiro's aunt from Big Hero 6, honestly. It was also fun to see how the movie also acknowledges her attractive powers,be it an extra dessert on the house, or characters straight out saying it. While not strong, she did hold a presence in the story.

Also, the film's ending has me hooked for the sequel.

So, yeah. That's my thoughts on the film.

Do share yours as well, and remember, end of the day, it's just my opinion.
