So, Humble Bundle is giving away Homefront for free. Downloaded it and decided to give the game a try.

Y'know, I had this whole idea of what to write about it, just why it was bad, and so on, but... god it's just shit.

It had an interesting premise and opening, but the execution is just so shit.

How the hell did this game get a sequel?
