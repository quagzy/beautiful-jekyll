So, there's this server I've started playing on, in Battlefield 4. Best connection for me.

Well, server fell rather empty today, and there I was, the massive Siege of Shanghai map, and two people on my team versus some five people on the enemy team.

Well, as far winning the match goes, I had already lost. So instead, I had some fun. Rather than a straight shooting game, I played like it was a survival game. 

And my god, was it fun. Me on the ground, shooting out the enemies in the attack helicopter as they try to capture a point, or hiding from the tanks as they fire in my general direction.

Watching the madness that is humanity as they brought down the skyscraper in the middle of the map just for fun.

Funny thing is, eventually the tables turned. The enemies left, we managed to capture and hold all the points. It was two of us against two of them, and we were able to hold them off.

Eventually... we won. With literally three seconds left on the clock, we won. By the end of it, it was two of us and an enemy. We didn't get annoyed, or hate each other. Just wished each other good night, having had some fun, and closed the game.

There was something about having this massive map, usually populated by some sixty-four players, but instead less than ten of us having the full run of it.

Something personal, something incredibly fun. I'd have to hide when I heard the enemy helo, or try and bait them into coming out so I could shoot them.

Or sneakily run off and capture an objective on the other side of the map.

Man, if only Shadowplay worked, I could have recorded it.
