Hello.

So, I'm just a dude who sometimes writes, mostly plays video games and watches anime and shows. Sometimes reads. Yup.

I do happen to have a book which will soon be published, titled, "The Bathroom Door." If you like doors, especially of the bathroom variety, the book will most likely disappoint you. Sorry 'bout that. 
You can find it on Amazon. Ebook versions are available on all Amazon stores, search under 'Quagzlor'.

For India: [Paperback](https://www.amazon.in/Bathroom-Door-Quagzlor/dp/9386487527/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523806864&sr=8-1&keywords=quagzlor) and [Ebook](https://www.amazon.in/Bathroom-Door-one-Other-Story-ebook/dp/B079Z961KH/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1523806864&sr=8-2&keywords=quagzlor)

For the US: [Ebook](https://www.amazon.com/Bathroom-Door-one-Other-Story-ebook/dp/B079Z961KH/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523806981&sr=8-1&keywords=quagzlor)

Also, I'm not sure if the email button works properly, so my e-mail is quagzlor.d@gmail.com in case you want to mail me.
