They say that you have to go out and seek adventure in order to find it. I don’t know who ‘they’ are, but that line works for this post, so let ‘they’=arbitrary person who says that.

Well, I say that adventure is all around you. You just need to be able to recognize it. Take last evening’s events, for example.

Friend of mine asks if I want to get some KFC off campus. I say sure, sounds good. He hands me two motorcycle helmets and tells me to meet him at the gate.

Sadly, the person whose bike he was planning to borrow had already left. Fuck it, we’ll walk and grab an auto rickshaw to the mall.

Now, it was around 7:30 PM by then, and our campus is in a developing industrial area. So it’s not the most safe looking (or indeed, safe in actuality) of places. And here we were, to guys holding helmets walking down to the main road.

Anyways, we get to the main road and flag down a rickshaw. Now, the rickshaws here work a bit differently than those in Delhi. You basically tell the driver where you want to go, and if it’s along his route you hop on, joining whoever else is already on it.

Many of these rickshaws have a bar at the back, connected to the roof, and one lower down. The idea being that you stand on the lower bar, and grab onto the roof one, and just hang off the back. Well, that’s what we did.

Funny thing is, it wasn’t all that scary. When the vehicle starts moving, you need to grip tightly so you don’t fall off, but once your inertia catches up to that of the vehicle, it’s fairly easy.

So, we make our way to the KFC, only to find it’s shut. So we make our way back to an earlier mall. Once there, my friend decides that he wants to try and cross the barbed wire fence instead of using the entrance. So, he climbs up a tree and hops over the fence.

We eat, then catch a ride back to campus.

In retrospect, it was a pretty simple outing, but it still felt like an adventure. It was exciting, new and fun.

So yeah. Adventure’s all around you. Just make sure you’re in an adventurous mood (see what I did there?).
