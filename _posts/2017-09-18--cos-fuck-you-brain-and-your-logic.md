Met this girl a few weeks back. Was fresher's night, and since I was the wise old 2nd year, I opted out of attending that, and instead fired up some Breath of the Wild on one of the common room televisions.

Was playing, when this cute girl, all dressed up, came up and asked, "Is that Zelda?" So long story short, we ended up hanging out for a good part of the night, at times with her friends there, at times without. So, I started thinking, wow, this girl's pretty cool. 

So we meet again a few days later, she comes over to my room and we share some food I got back from home. We talked for a while, till she had to leave thanks to the college's residence life policies.

Now by this time, I'd figured out that I was attracted to her. Heck, I'd taken a few pointers from some friends, a first for me.

But y'know, I couldn't really tell if she was interested in me. I haven't really had much luck in the past, so it was a bit of an uncomfortable, nagging feeling.

Eventually, I convinced myself that she surely didn't like me, and wasn't worth pursuing. So, I stilled my heart, and sort of put it away. Hadn't met her all this while either, so guess that helped.

Then I come across her during dinner at the mess today. Say hi, we're both with friends, so sit separately and so on. Had a bit of a shit day myself, so didn't really push for interaction. Then as she leaves, her meal finished, she just gives me a smile and a wave.

Aaaaand... yup. All that convincing myself I did? Hah, screw that, that shit's nothing.

Well, fuck.

Quick Edit: I did show her this blog once, so on the veeeeeery off chance that she's reading this. Um. Hi. I was planning on telling you, I'm not that much of a wuss. But um... yeah.
