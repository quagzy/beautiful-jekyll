Just walked in to class, saw some people studying.

"What, do we have a test today?"
"Yeah, on Markov's Expectation. Didin't you know?"
"Oh fuck me."

Professor's sitting there, watching this exchange.

I sit down, open up the laptop, try to cram a bit. Prof starts the class. Attendance seems rather low today.

...I think Paul lied to me. Paul, you cock. Nice one if we don't really have a test.
