I suppose I ought to preface this by saying that I'm not a pervert, I swear. (That's for the benefit of anyone who's seen the anime.)

So leading from that line, it's easy to guess that this anime is one of "those". Yeah, the series which makes people think that anime is some weird stuff with naked people and incest.

Mind, you're not off the mark, considering that the protagonist has a little sister fetish and a couple of characters seem to get naked every episode.

...Again, I swear I'm not a pervert or weirdo.

Honestly, I'm surprised at myself. Usually I'd have stopped watching this within the first few episodes, yet... something kept me watching. Something kept pulling me back, and I finally understood what it is, one episode from the season finale.

It has a good story. It's that simple. It's something that forgives so much of the weirdness, the things which make turn the volume down at certain scenes, which make me squirm uncomfortably when my elder sister messages me, the fact that I can't watch this in public without getting some seriously creeped out glances.

The characters have ambitions and plans, they have some depth, they have events which have shaped them and which will continue to do so. It's a story that I can sort of relate to, considering I do have an interest in writing, heck, which pushed me to write this after such a long period of silence.

Something that pushed me to write even when no one will read.
