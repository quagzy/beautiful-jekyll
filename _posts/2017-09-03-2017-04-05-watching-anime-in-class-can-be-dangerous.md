Boku no Hero Acadameia’s second season has begun.

If you’ve ever watched it, you’ll know just how exciting it can be. Watching young Deku as he learns to control his power and see how his path to becoming a hero goes.

It’s a show that can inspire a range of emotions, from laughter, to empathetic sadness, to making you want to cheer him on (as I’ve done quite literally. Hope my neighbors don’t hate me.)

Taking such a show and watching it during class is like attacking a chicken in Zelda. It never ends well.

Buuuuut… episode 1 is just waiting for me, and it’s not like i pay attention anyways…

hmm.
