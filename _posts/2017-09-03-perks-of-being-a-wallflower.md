So… I wrote a forum post on this, and honestly, I’m just going to copy-paste it here, because it just covers what I’d say so neatly.

 

Watched Perks of Being a Wallflower last night with some friends.
I knew it was supposed to be emotional, but…

First time i just broke down crying in a while. heck, i tear up just thinking of it.
I’m not even sure what got me, really.
Maybe just being reminded of what i’d been through. what i felt i’d missed out on.

So spoilers ahead if you haven’t seen it.

The scene that really resonated with me was towards the end, when he was in the hospital.
Says that they should discharge him, as he knew his parent’s couldn’t afford it.
When i was in the deep end of self harm, the doctor wanted to put me under observation. I refused, because i knew it would be expensive. That’s it.
I mean… you’d think that it’s worth the cost, considering it’s my life, but that’s the thing. At that point, it felt like it was worthless.

Heck, still feel that way sometimes.

So yeah. Good movie.
