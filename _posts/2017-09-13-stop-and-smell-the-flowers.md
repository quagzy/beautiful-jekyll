I have a class at 10:10am most mornings. I usually walk into the room, and sit at my laptop and sometimes have some tea, while I wait for the professor.

This morning, however, there was already a class in progress. So I had to wait outside. Now, this room is on the ground floor, and there's... a ledge of sorts? Well, something that separates the academic block from the grounds, just a wall with a raised area, where people can pull themselves up and sit.

So, tea in hand, I sat, and watched the sprinklers as they watered the grounds. A slight breeze, a fairly quiet campus. On a whim, I even played the calm Minecraft music.
