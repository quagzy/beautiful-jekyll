It is 2am, and I've just finished moving all of my posts from my old blog. It was hosted on WordPress, but I wanted more control over it and a short URL, so I've moved it here, to Github.

Spent some 6+ hours trying to figure everything out, but here we are. Looks good and I've got my submission system in place.

Now, just have to make sure to update my manuscript with this link...
