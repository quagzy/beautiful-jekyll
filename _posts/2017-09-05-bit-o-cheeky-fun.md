Had a bit of fun today. Friend got a call from a girl who he didn't want to answer, so I went ahead and took the call.

Cue a 5 to 10 minute call, where said girl is completely oblivious to the fact that I'm not said friend. Which was pretty amusing.

His girlfriend called, so I answered that as well. Props to her, she was able to tell that I sounded off right from the get go.

Tried calling one of my female friends, with him talking to her. She was able to tell that it wasn't me as well.

Conclusion? Heck if I know, but it was fun.
