Sublime Text is a nice text editor.

To be fair, I haven’t exactly sampled a great number of them. I should go to text-con one day, sample the various text editors and fonts. Argue about serifs and what have you. (Text-con isn’t a real event. Yet.)

Till then I guess I’ll just change the colours on Sublime Text so that I can feel cool.
