So I've been playing League of Legends for a while, and I'll admit that I'm enjoying myself (shocker considering it's League, I know).

I usually fill the support role, and as anyone who's been keeping up with the game would know, two champions were released at the same time; Xayah and Rakan, an ADC and support.

What makes these characters unique is that they have moves which synergise with each other. Lore-wise, they're meant to be lovers. So when you're backing to base, one can join the other and they'll back together.

Or Rakan gets a larger range from which he can dash to Xayah and shield her, or how one of Xayah's abilities uses feathers from Rakan as well, if he's nearby. Or how... well, that's it to be honest, in terms of abilities.

But for interactions... well for instance, if one starts dancing, and the other joins in, they'll start dancing together.

During combat, you'll often hear them talking to each other. If Rakan shields Xayah, he'll say something like "Got you honey!" and she'll reply, "Thanks dear!".

While nothing special in terms of dialogue, where this shines is the fact that it makes these characters seem so alive. The fact that they interact with each other, that they have lines depending on the situation; Rakan, if Xayah is dead and is respawning, will say something along the lines of looking for Xayah, wondering where she is; all of this brings so much life to the characters.

I love playing as Rakan with a Xayah because of this, the way they just seem to have so much more character.

While I understand that it isn't really feasible to do this for so many champions (considering it's 150+), I still wish there could be more of this.

Oh well.
