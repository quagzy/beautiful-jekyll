title: Added My Anime and Manga Lists

I've added a new button to the nav-bar, which links to the anime and manga that I've watched/follow. Considering I keep a spreadsheet, figuered I could share it.

Yeah. That's about it. Visitors can also add comments if they want, but yeah.

Edit: Seems I can't directly embed the spreadsheet, so it's a link to the sheet instead.
