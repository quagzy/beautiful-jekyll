I'm not really one for dance, but I gotta say, [Earth Wind and Fire's September](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs069dndIYk) is just so... groovy.

I mean I'm up at 2 am playing through Guild Wars 2 Path of Fire, when the servers crash. Decide it's time for bed. See the video, and listen to it. Started dancing along to it.

Not just sitting in my chair moving my torso either. I mean legwork too, it's just too good. Quite a rarity. Just the music playing, the entire house is quiet (am home for the weekend), completely dark outside, and I'm just groovin' to the music. 

Almost something out of the end of a movie. But damn, that's some good music.
