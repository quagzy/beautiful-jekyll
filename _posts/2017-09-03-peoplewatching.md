I saw a rather cute sight on the metro today. There was this man standing with a woman, and they were talking with each other. He kept his hand on her arm, kept squeezing it every now and then, and he was smiling while talking to her. It was quite obvious that he had strong feelings for her. If not that, certainly very attracted.

She had her back to me, so body language was all I had to go by, but it seemed she felt the same for him. No visible discomfort, relaxed body posture, no attempts to move away.

Eventually his stop came, so he gave her a hug(which she returned) and left. She sort of stood there, hands clasped in front of her, watching him go. And then she gave him a little, excited wave as he turned around to look at her again. I could see the edge of her mouth in a smile.

This scene of course set me smiling as well, and as I turned away from it, my eyes met that of another traveler who was watching this as well. He too was smiling at it, and it felt like we just exchanged a silent moment of amusement over those two.

Just felt nice to watch two adults trying to hide their excitement and feelings for each other.

I wish them the best, whoever they are.
