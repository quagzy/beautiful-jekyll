So, met with some people at the centre for entrepreunership at uni a few days back. Discussed the idea of a makerspace, and seems that they want it.

Going in I was worried that I'd have to lowball it, so that it didn't seem too expensive, but seems that they want it to be big. Something to compete with top unis.

Awww yiss. Laser CNC, here I come.
