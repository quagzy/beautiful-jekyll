I got that chance to play the Destiny 2 beta on my PC. I enjoyed it, but what's really drawing me to the series is the lore behind it.

If you ever look at a game, or look at a fictional epic, I wouldn't fault you for saying that they tend to follow similar patterns. Sure, they have different settings, and politics, factions, motivations and all that nonsense may be different. But the crux of the style is that conflict has happened, things are in disarray, or are about to be, and the central character steps up to save the day.

So what I find curious is how, in spite of that, in spite of knowing what lies ahead, I still love to read about it. Something about Warhammer 40k's war against the xenos draws me in and fascinates me. I want to explore the story of humanity's survival against the darkness in Destiny. I want to learn more about the First Flame and the cycle in Dark Souls.

A curious thing, honestly. Also makes me wonder if scattered lore is more interesting, seeing as how in all the above cases, I've had to scour wikis for information, rather than reading it in one simple volume. I think it's likely due to the fact that it feels more spread out, more comprehensive, than it being told in a single tome.

Rather than how it is told in, say, The Lord of the Rings, the information covers so many topics, and feels so fleshed out. (Disclaimer: I am aware of Tolkien's other writings, such as the Silmarilion, and Unfinished Tales and such. Just drawing a comparison between a single source and multiple wiki articles.)

Either way, can't wait to see how we fight against the Cabal in Destiny 2. I mean, I did watch My Name is Byf's one and a half hour lore video to catch up. Also feels good to play something by Bungie again.
