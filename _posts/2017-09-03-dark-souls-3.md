So, I bought Dark Souls 3 with a season pass yesterday.

I’ve played the pirated version before, but just before the second boss, I got kinda annoyed and cheated by beefing up my stats with a trainer program.

I’ve started fresh, no cheats, fully legitimate this time. Been at least 4-5 months since I last played.

My video games skills are a curious thing. They’re a bit like wine. First you form the skills (ie learn how to play) then you just leave it alone for a bit. Let it age. The longer it ages, the better it turns out.

Well, I beat Iudex Gundyr, the first boss, in one go. The first time I played, it took over 20 tries. I beat the Master (this really tough enemy) in my second go.

W-wha? Not that I’m complaining, of course.
