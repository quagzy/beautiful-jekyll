Hello.

So, I'm just a dude who sometimes writes, mostly plays video games and watches anime and shows. Sometimes reads. Yup.

I do happen to have a book which will soon be published, titled, "The Bathroom Door." If you like doors, especially of the bathroom variety, the book will most likely disappoint you. Sorry 'bout that. I'll add a link here to it's amazon page or something once it's up.

Also, I'm not sure if the email button works properly, so my e-mail is quagzlor.d@gmail.com in case you want to mail me.
