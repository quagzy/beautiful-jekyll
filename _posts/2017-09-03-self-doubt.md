So, I’ve got these two stories that are going to be published. The contract’s been signed, stories approved, I just need to finish editing them and send them in, and I’m done.

But I just can’t get myself to do it. I hate them. I hate what I’ve written, I think it’s trash. So I just can’t bring myself to finish them.
