So I actually finished Guild Wars 2's Path of Fire expansion a while back. Just haven't gotten around to writing about it.

So, the basic, spoiler-free version. As compared to Heart of Thorns, this expansion shines. The story is interesting (not mind blowing or incredible, but pretty good) and the enemies are interesting. There is one mission which I love in the story, which re-affirms something which I love about the game. Without spoiling it, let's just say that your work in saving Tyria is recognised. This is something which so few games do, and it feels wonderful to actually be acknowledged as a major world player.

So let's go bit by bit. First off, mounts. I love them. I absolutely love them. They are fun, have interesting abilities, and most importantly, they look _alive_. My personal favourite is the skimmer, there's something incredibly graceful and calming about it.

I do have one gripe, which is that you have to pay gold to unlock the mount. Personally, I'm not a fan of this, considering that the Jackal, he 4th mount, costs 20G in addition to 200 trade contracts to unlock. The "secret" 5th mount, which everyone knows about by now, the Griffon, costs 250G, in addition to having to complete a number of tasks. Not a fan of that, though I guess it's a reward for those who put in the work. It's a gripe I can get over.

I do look forward to seeing more customization options, though. Currently they only have one dye slot each, though I imagine that Arenanet has skins planned in future updates for them.

Unfortunately I don't have much to say on the new Elite Specs, as I've only finished Scourge so far. That said, people seem to enjoy them, so honestly, try them out, and see what works, as preferences can be quite personal.

Best for last, the maps.

Oh my god the maps.

They are absolutely GORGEOUS. Entering the highlands for the first time, I looked into the sky, and my god. Seeing that spectral city in the stars was such a beautiful sight. I love how the desert is alive, and not just piles of sand. You have areas of greenery, you have mountains, you have areas Branded by Kralkatorrik. You have an actual world.

This even extends into the story. Some of the story exclusive locations are absolutely magnificent, and I'm starting to run out of synonyms to describe them. It's wonderful to see the effort put into even story areas, and the world in general.

One detail pointed out on Reddit, which I appreciate was that character dialogues, even for non-essential NPCs felt so fleshed out and interactive. You could actually discuss things, without people going off in a huff.

So, yeah. It's $30. Go get it. Stop reading, GO! It's some good shit.

(A note on the sound. I ended up playing while listening to music, so unfortunately I missed out on that. Will rectify.)
