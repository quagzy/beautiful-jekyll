title: The History Around Us

Been a while since I last posted. Several months, in fact.

Then again, not like people read this anyways, save one.

I remembered something from a history course, where the professor pointed out that you can never truly show the past; it will always be just from one perspective, and will always be missing details. Either it will be too specific, or too broad, and even then, you would have to capture the very thoughts of people themselves, and...

Well, you get the idea.

Then I saw this post about an old stone tablet, which was simply a complaint about the grade of copper someone received from a merchant. Something so simple, everyday, and yet it's become something of significance.

Well, thought followed thought, and I got to thinking about how each of us has something special and unique to us, something with a history of significance to a select few. Maybe something as simple as a ticket stub from a convention, or an old note written by a high school crush.

There's this online game called Dungeons and Dragons Online. It has some online forums, which as usual has an off-topic section. There, there's a pinned thread about the 'Cupcake Muskateers.'

Now, this thread isn't exactly something special. You go on it, it's just a few regulars talking about their day, discussing a few things, very casual conversation.

Yet the thread has a significant history, one which not many would know.

The original thread was started... well, I can't even remember when, by the namesake, Cupcake. Same  content, some of the same people, so on. Unfortunately, the content was lost when the forums had an upgrade, and thus a new thread was created.

Time passed, and people came, people left. I joined around... 2011, 2012 is a safe guess. More than six years ago.

More time, more interactions, another forum move that thankfully left the thread intact, and we got some interesting news...

Now, us regulars would post often, maybe a few posts a week. As a result, the thread kept growing, easily keeping ahead as the largest thread on the forums.

So large, in fact, that it was causing issues with the rest of the forums. So, the thread was locked, immortalised in the forums' hall of fame for a some time, and a new one created and pinned, to finally acknowledge just how much a regular sight we were in the forums.

Now, outside of the Dungeons and Dragons Online community, we had little impact, and even less renown. Yet, were we ever to disappear from the forums, I'd like to think that we'd be missed, or our absence at least be noted.

Brings up thoughts of how just some simple thing we do can become part of someone else's world, and just how even small actions can have such an impact.

Like a stream of water, slowly eroding a rock.
