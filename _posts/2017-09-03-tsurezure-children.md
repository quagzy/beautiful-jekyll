Been watching this anime called Tsurezure Children. Each episode consists of multiple shorts, for a total episode time of 12 minutes.

Follows high school kids as they go through asking each other out, dating and such. Very casual, slice of life. Not usually my cup of tea, but this specific series... it's both adorable and absolutely hilarious. Not to mention, it doesn't beat around the bush with progression, so a lot more satisfying romance wise than what, maybe 70% or more of anime out there? (63.5% of stats you see on the internet are made up.)

Either way, definitely worth checking out if you just want something cute and funny to watch.

Also a quick note, seeing as how I maintain a Google Spreedsheet of the series I follow, I'm considering adding a link to it. Then again, not like anyone really reads this blog save maybe one or two people, so not really any rush yet.
